## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This portfolio presents my Masterâ€™s capstone research project, which investigates the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of chronic pain across individuals and countries. While chronic pain is often approached through biomedical perspectives, this study highlights the impact of structural and demographic factors such as GDP per capita, civil conflict, education, age, and gender.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives
- Assess whether higher GDP per capita is associated with lower chronic pain.
- Evaluate the impact of living in civil conflict zones on pain levels.
- Determine how education, age, and gender influence pain prevalence.
- Explore interaction effects between socioeconomic and demographic factors.

---

## ðŸ“Š Data & Methodology
- **Data Source:** World Health Survey
- **Population:** Individuals aged 20â€“60 from multiple countries
- **Variables:**  
  - GDP per capita (log-transformed)  
  - Civil conflict status (0/1)  
  - Education level (ordinal)  
  - Age (years)  
  - Gender (female = 1)  
  - Body pain score (1â€“5)
- **Analytical Methods:**  
  - OLS regression for continuous pain scores  
  - Logistic regression for binary chronic pain risk  
  - Interaction models (Age Ã— Education, GDP Ã— Conflict, Age Ã— Gender)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- **GDP per capita** â€“ Higher GDP is significantly linked to lower pain scores.
- **Civil conflict** â€“ Living in conflict zones increases pain prevalence.
- **Education** â€“ Higher education reduces reported pain.
- **Age** â€“ Older individuals report higher pain levels.
- **Gender** â€“ Females report higher pain than males.
- **Interactions** â€“ Education mitigates age-related pain increases; GDP buffers conflictâ€™s impact on pain.

## ðŸ’¡ Policy Implications
- Expand healthcare access in low-GDP and conflict-affected regions.
- Invest in education as a preventative public health measure.
- Implement gender- and age-specific pain management programs.
